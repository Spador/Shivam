# Shivam Parashar â€” Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, deployed on **GitHub Pages**.

It highlights:
- My background in **Software Engineering, DevOps, Cloud, and Data**
- Projects and certifications
- Easy-to-navigate sections for skills, experience, and education

### How I built it
- Designed a custom single-page layout (no frameworks, just clean vanilla JS/CSS).
- Added animations (typing effect, scroll reveals) for a modern look.
- Made the content configurable through one file: `config.js`.
- Deployed using **GitHub Pages** for free hosting.
